"""Manage remote connector accounts served through the tool gateway.

``manage_connections`` is the never-deferred surface for connection
lifecycle:

- ``status`` — which connectors exist for this account and whether each is
  connected (read-only).
- ``connect`` / ``reconnect`` — start (or restart) an authorization flow.
  The gateway returns a connect link, passed through UN-redacted: the model
  shows it to the user, who opens it in a browser. Each connector's
  ``instruction`` text is surfaced once per session, not on every call.
- ``wait`` — block inside the call until the named connectors report
  connected, or the budget runs out. A model has no clock: told to wait it
  says "I'll check back in a minute" and its next action lands immediately,
  so guidance produced a burst of polls rather than a paced one. Waiting
  inside the call cannot be skipped and works the same on every platform.

Scope: managed connectors AND local MCP servers. ``{"name": ..., "mcp": true}`` targets take
``install`` / ``enable`` / ``authorize`` through one connection operation
(``connections_tool_operation.py``, ``connections_tool_mcp.py``); the approval card is reached
only via the inline executor, so non-GUI surfaces get ``unavailable`` for MCP targets.

De-authentication is deliberately NOT exposed to the model: disconnecting
an account is a user decision, made in the portal dashboard.

Availability: the managed leg is portal-gated in the handler; MCP targets need no sign-in.
