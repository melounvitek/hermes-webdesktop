    rewrites committed lockfiles (stripping ``"peer": true`` etc.), which leaves
    the working tree dirty and causes the next ``hermes update`` to stash the
    lockfile — repeatedly.

    ``--include=dev`` is forced on every invocation: the callers are frontend
    builds (web UI / TUI / desktop workspaces), and those builds need the dev
    toolchain (``tsc``, ``vite``, ``electron-builder`` — all

    devDependencies (exit 0, no error), so the build toolchain never installs
