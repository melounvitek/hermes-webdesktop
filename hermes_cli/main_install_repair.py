    False to continue the sync in-process.

    Called at the dependency-sync boundary, NOT at the top of the command —
    the same placement rule as the native-module deferral beside it, and for
    the same reason (#86735): a hand-off that fires before the fetch detaches
    every run, including the ``Already up to date!`` no-op that never touches
    the venv at all, and it takes the interactive prompts with it. By the time
    we reach here the code swap is done and every question — stash, branch
    switch, config migration — has already been asked and answered in the
    user's own console. Only the venv rewrite is left, and that is the single
    step that genuinely cannot run from inside the shim.

    ``venv\\Scripts\\hermes.exe`` is a launcher that runs the interpreter with
    the shim as its script and holds it open without ``FILE_SHARE_DELETE`` for
    the whole command, so the quarantine rename is refused and uv fails to
    replace it with os error 32 (#88838, #89599).

    A child is required, and waiting on it cannot work: this process holds the
    handle the child needs released, so a parent that waits deadlocks against
    the work it is waiting for. Windows has no exec to escape with either.
    The shell therefore returns while the install runs on; the child keeps the
    console and prints its own result, and ``--gateway`` writes the true exit
    code to ``.update_exit_code`` for the gateway watcher.

    The child re-runs ``hermes update``, so the whole remaining flow — the
    dependency sync and the node/web/lazy-refresh tail behind it — still
    happens exactly once. ``_UPDATE_REEXEC_ENV`` marks it so it cannot spawn
    another child, and so the "already up to date" early return does not
    swallow the sync it was spawned to perform (the checkout is current by
    now; that is the point).

    The caller has already written ``.update-incomplete``, so a child that
    dies mid-install is finished by the next launch's recovery instead of
    leaving a half-synced venv. Anything that stops the hand-off (no venv
    python, spawn refused) returns False and syncs in-process, where the
    pre-existing os-error-32 path and its marker recovery still apply.

    Windows allows RENAMING a mapped/running executable (the kernel tracks the
    file by handle, not path), but blocks DELETE/REPLACE while it's loaded. uv
    needs to overwrite the entry-point shims during ``pip install -e .``;
    when ``hermes update`` runs, ``hermes.exe`` IS the live process, and uv
    fails with ``Access is denied. (os error 5)``.

    We rename live shims to ``hermes.exe.old.<unix-ms>`` first. uv then writes
    fresh shims at the original paths. The ``.old`` files are cleaned up on
    the next hermes invocation by ``_cleanup_quarantined_exes``.

    Rename can still fail when *another* process has opened the .exe without
    ``FILE_SHARE_DELETE`` — typically AV real-time scanners with transient
    handles (recovers in <1s), or the Hermes Desktop backend child process
    (won't recover until the user closes it). We mitigate:

    1. Retry up to ``max_attempts`` times with exponential backoff
       (100/250/500/1000 ms). Handles the AV-scanner case.
    2. If all retries fail, print a clear warning naming the most likely
       culprit (running Hermes Desktop / gateway / REPL).

    The updater's own launcher is no longer one of those culprits: an update
    started from ``hermes.exe`` re-runs itself under the venv Python before
    reaching here (``_reexec_dependency_sync_off_windows_shim``).

    Returns the list of (original, quarantined) pairs so the caller can roll
    back if the install itself fails before uv writes a replacement.

    ``failed_out``: when provided, the names of shims whose rename failed on
    every attempt are appended — callers that must not mutate a contended
    venv (the update dependency sync, #87331) check it and refuse instead of
    letting the install run into a half-broken state.
