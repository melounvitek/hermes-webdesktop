    WebSocket close.

    `profile` (when set) scopes the ENTIRE chat to that profile by pointing
    ``HERMES_HOME`` at the profile dir in the child env. Every spawned
    process (the TUI and the ``tui_gateway.entry`` it launches) resolves
    ``get_hermes_home()`` from that env var at its own import, so the child
    binds the profile's config, skills, memory, and state.db from the start
    — the same propagation ``hermes -p <name>`` performs. The in-process
    ``HERMES_TUI_GATEWAY_URL`` attach is SKIPPED for scoped chats: the
    dashboard's in-memory gateway runs under the dashboard's own profile,
    so a profile-scoped chat must spawn its own gateway subprocess.
